# Building Effective Agents – LangGraph & CrewAI Colab Series

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for my multi-pattern agent design assignment. This project demonstrates:

- Core agent design patterns from the *Building Effective Agents* framework.
- Implementation using two orchestration libraries: **LangGraph** and **CrewAI**.
- Each pattern is structured in Colab notebooks with LangSmith/agent trace walkthroughs.
- All notebooks are **original**, agent-aware, and carefully explained in video walkthroughs.

## 🎥 Video Walkthroughs

Each Colab has been executed, traced, and explained in a dedicated walkthrough video:

## ✅ LangGraph Patterns

### 📘 [1_prompt_chaining.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1YP4izMwtkAb9P2HOI0TcOQtEamZxn3K5?usp=sharing)
> **Focus**: Sequential refinement of LLM output through prompt chaining.

- Generated a joke → improved it → polished it
- Used a quality gate to stop or continue
- Illustrated LangGraph conditional transitions



## 🤝 CrewAI Patterns

### 📘 [1_prompt_chaining_crewai.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Ql81CNtKzraEU3PeyQpcVE06_pT87-2n?usp=sharing)
> **Focus**: Sequential improvement via role-based agents.

- Writer → Improver → Editor agents
- Agent chaining using CrewAI task delegation
- Structured response flow across roles
